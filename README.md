# Video Text Overlay

A powerful application for adding intelligent text overlays to videos with object detection, developed by [Shotcut.in](https://shotcut.in).

## üåü Overview

Video Text Overlay is a sophisticated web application that combines state-of-the-art object detection with professional text overlay capabilities. Built with Streamlit, it offers an intuitive interface for adding text to videos while respecting the presence of detected objects in the scene.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intelligent Text Overlays**: Smart text placement that interacts with detected objects
- **Multi-layer Text Support**: Create unlimited text layers with independent styling
- **Advanced Object Detection**: Powered by YOLOv8 segmentation
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant visualization of your text overlays
- **Professional Text Styling**:
  - Complete Merriweather font family support
  - Full control over size, color, opacity
  - Precise positioning and rotation
  - Multiple font weights
- **Flexible Detection Settings**: Adjustable confidence and IOU thresholds

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd video-text-overlay
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download YOLOv8 model:
```bash
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8s-seg.pt
```

4. Set up fonts:
   - Download Merriweather font family
   - Place font files in the `fonts/` directory

## üöÄ Usage
